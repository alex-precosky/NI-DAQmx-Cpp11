Demonstrating Digital IO with NI_DAQmx in VS.NET 2013 C++

Get your digital IO C++ project on Windows started on National Instruments hardware with this!

It reads and writes digital bits from/to a digital input and output pin and times how long it takes to do these.  I used a USB-6215 as my data acquisition device for it.

Included some graphics from a logic analyzer capture of the output of the digital pin and a screenshot of some timing analysis.
